If list is "*" no check is done and the function returns TRUE immediately. An empty list always returns FALSE (See t3lib_div::cmpIP!).

    description = <h2 class="typo3-tstemplate-ceditor-subcat">Instructions</h2><p>This extension enables clearing TYPO3 via an HTTP request. The request is only available on a specific page (Plugin Page) and remote addresses which are allowed to execute a clear cache command can be restricted (Allowed Remote IPs). In addition, the pages which can have their cache cleared must be defined (Enabled Pages).</p><p>For example, a request to:<br /><b>www.mysite.com/?id=142&clearPageCache=9,10,15&secretKey=blabla</b><br />will clear the cache of pages 9, 10 & 15 provided the conditions (Plugin Page, Allowed Remote IPs and Enabled Pages as well as the API key) are validated. Note that in the above example, if only page 10 can have it's cache cleared, the request to clear the cache of pages 9 & 15 is ignored while the cache of page 10 is cleared.</p>
